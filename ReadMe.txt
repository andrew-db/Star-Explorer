This is my very first game built with Corona Labs, and one thing I really enjoy about a fun game is some hidden easter eggs. So good luck on finding them all ðŸ˜‚

This project exhibits basic built-in Corona vector shapes and how to apply solid, gradient, or image fills to the center (fill) or border (stroke).

This project also exhibits a basic "point" type emitter object where particles are emitted from a single point in space.

Use the slider controls to dynamically change the emission angle, speed, and gravity applied to the particles. Tap the color channel buttons to adjust the red, green, blue, and alpha values for the emitted particles.
